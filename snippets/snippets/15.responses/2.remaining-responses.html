            This is the cheapest way I can see to do it. I think if you go any
            cheaper than this you risk having poor quality. If you can't afford everything
            right now, maybe start working on a bunch of things you want to talk about, and
            save up. Then when you are ready to buy the equipment, you will have a bunch of
            material, and you can just start recording immediately. Just a thought :).

            Yeah I understand what you are saying, was just hoping to start
            it sooner, but never mind.
